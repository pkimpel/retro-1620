1. 1443 printer check is reset by BI/BNI, but only if not a sync check?

2. When op code 00 is detected in I-1, should STOP be set, or should the
processor be halted immediately by setting MANUAL? Germain p.27 indicates that
it stops like an H (48) instruction, but pressing the START key after that
results in a MAR check stop. Intermediate diagrams indicate MANUAL is set in
I-1, but doesn't show how the check stop occurs.

3. What action should be taken for undefined op codes? NOP? Check Stop?
Germain p.27 indicates invalid op codes cause a MAR check stop.

4. How should "undigits" (hex A-F) be handled? Germain p.27 indicates that
arithmetic on such digits results in a MAR check stop, or on the Mod2, sometimes
an MBR (MIR?) check.

5. What happens when a BB (42) is executed with no prior BT* (07/17/27) or SAVE
key to set the return address? Mod 2 Ref p.38 indicates that causes a MAR check
stop, but Germain p.97 states that IR2 remains valid after a BB and can be used
again.

6. Should XBR be cleared in I-5? Intermediate Diagrams don't indicate this, but
it's done in I-1 in preparation for indexing the P address.

7. How are the Q10/Q11 digits handled in I-6 for I/O ops?

8. Is the START key effective only in MANUAL mode? Intermediate Diagrams don't
appear to indicate that, but Mod2 Ref p.75 says so.

9. Gate DISPLAY_MAR is turned on by the DISPLAY MAR key, but what turns it off,
other than the RESET key?

10. In I-5, OR1 is not written if it's an "S/B op" or an immediate op. Exactly
what are the "S/B ops"? Assume that includes BI/BNI. What about SB (60), I/O
ops?

11. In I-6, same question as #10.
