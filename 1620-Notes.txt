1. 1443 printer check is reset by BI/BNI, but only if not a sync check?

2. When op code 00 is detected in I-1, should STOP be set, or should the
processor be halted immediately by setting MANUAL? Germain p.27 indicates that
it stops like an H (48) instruction, but pressing the START key after that
results in a MAR check stop. Intermediate diagrams indicate MANUAL is set in
I-1, but doesn't show how the check stop occurs.
[CORRECTED 2022-12-07: op code 00 puts system into MANUAL, will check stop
if START is then pressed]

3. What action should be taken for undefined op codes? NOP? Check Stop?
Germain p.27 indicates invalid op codes cause a MAR check stop.
[COMPLETED 2023-01-01: invalid op codes cause MAR check stop]

4. How should "undigits" (hex A-F) be handled? Germain p.27 indicates that
arithmetic on such digits results in a MAR check stop, or on the Mod2, sometimes
an MBR (MIR?) check.

5. What happens when a BB (42) is executed with no prior BT* (07/17/27) or SAVE
key to set the return address? Mod 2 Ref p.38 indicates that causes a MAR check
stop, but Germain p.97 states that on the Model 2 IR2 remains valid after a BB
and can be used again.

6. Should XBR be cleared in I-5? Intermediate Diagrams don't indicate this, but
it's done in I-1 in preparation for indexing the P address, so why wouldn't it
be don in preparation for indexing the Q address?

7. How are the Q10/Q11 digits handled in I-6 for I/O ops?
[RESOLVED 2022-12-10: they remain in MBR and are examined in I/O selection
during I-6]

8. Is the START key effective only in MANUAL mode? Intermediate Diagrams don't
appear to indicate that, but Mod2 Ref p.75 says so. I'm currently requiring
MANUAL mode, since doing a START while the processor is already running could
initiate a second run() and cause havoc.
[RESOLVED 2023-01-10: the Model 2 CPU Reference Manual (page 75) indicates the
START key is effective only in MANUAL mode]

9. Gate DISPLAY_MAR is turned on by the DISPLAY MAR key, but what turns it off,
other than the RESET key?

10. In I-5, OR1 is not written if it's an "S/B op" or an immediate op. Exactly
what are the "S/B ops"? Assume that includes BI/BNI. What about SB (60), I/O
ops?

11. In I-6, same question as #10.

12. Consider setting CLR MEM by mouse-down on the MODIFY key, drag to the CHECK
RESET key, and then mouse-up to simulate a simultaneous press of the two keys
(Dave Babcock's idea).
[COMPLETED 2022-12-17]

13. Consider having the MARS Selector switch detect clicks on either side of the
knob pointer and moving the pointer one step in the direction towards the click
rather than one step in the "current" direction.
[COMPLETED 2022-12-17]

14. Need more 1620-like toggle switches for the Control Panel.

15. Clicking one of the dark blue bottons on the lower panel of the Control
Panel animates the click by applying a darker style to the button. If you click
and hold, then drag outside the button and release, there's no mouse up event
fired on the button, and it stays dark. This does not affect the button's
subsequent operation, though.
[COMPLETED 2022-12-26]

16. Need to implement the Emergency Off switch on the Control Panel, if only as
a static image.
