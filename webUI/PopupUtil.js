* IBM 1620 emulator popup window opening module.
* Queues window open requests and processes them to completion sequentially.
* This attempts to defeat browsers that limit how quickly a page can open
* sub-windows if there has been no user action to trigger the open.
*
* Attempts to open a window for an entry in the queue. If the open fails,
* requeues the request entry back to the head of the queue, increases the
* delay time between attempts, and schedules a retry for the request using
* that delay. If the attempt succeeds, attaches a load event to the new
* window, then if the queue is non-empty schedules the next entry using the
* current delay time.
