Miscellaneous scripts and developer utilities:

1620CRDExtract.html
    Script that reads one or more binary IBM 1620 card image files as a
    text blob and converts binary 12-bit column punch masks to ASCII.
    Originally developed to convert ".crd" files to ASCII from
    http://bitsavers.org/bits/IBM/1620/games/.

    The blob is assumed to be in a format where each card column is
    represented as a pair of bytes. The first byte has the binary code
    for punches 6-7-8-9 in the high-order digit of the byte with the
    second digit being zero. The second byte has the binary code for
    punches 12-11-0-1 in the first digit and the binary code for punches
    2-3-4-5 in the second digit. Thus a column with "D" (12-4) would be
    encoded has hex 00 82, a space would be encoded as 00 00, and a "."
    (12-3-8) would be encoded as 02 84.

    To use, select the .bcd file(s) using the file selection control on
    the page. The script writes a log of activity to the web page.
    Outputs the converted data by opening a browser window for each file
    and inserting the converted text into a <textarea> element in that
    window. From there you can copy the text and paste it into another
    program that can save the data to a local filesystem.

Adder-Gen.html
    Script to generate complete 1620 adder results from the logic in
    Drawing 10.01.31.1 of the Model 2 ILD manual. See
    http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/1620/fe/227-5857-0_1620_Model_2_Custome
    r_Engineering_Intermediate_Level_Diagrams_Apr64.pdf.

Adder-Gen-Bit-4.html
    Script to detect problems in the bit-4 logic for the 1620 adder
    described in Drawing 10.01.31.1 of the Model 2 ILD manual. The
    drawing had an error in the last term for that bit.

Diacritics.html
    HTML page to explore various ways of formatting over-bars on
    characters to represent 1620 flag bits using a number of different
    fonts.

Lamp-Color-Test.html
    HTML/CSS page to explore progression of control panel lamp colors
    from full brightness to off.

Parity-Gen.html
    Script to generate a table of correct 6-bit odd parity for all
    possible 6-bit input combinations.

retro-1620-Original-Memory-Preload.cmem
    Core memory image file to debug the original instruction decode,
    indexing, and indirect addressing behavior in the retro-1620
    emulator. This code was originally built into the initialization of
    the emulator and is preserved here mostly for nostalgic purposes.

SimH-Disk-Pack-File-Decoder.html
    Script to convert a SimH I1620 emulator binary disk pack (.dp) image
    file format to the disk pack dump format used by retro-1620.

SPS-Object-Deck-Lister.wsf
    VBScript script to convert the non-consolidated card punch output
    from the card-based SPS assembler to a listing in the format of the
    SPS-IID 1443 line printer version.

SPS-Xscript-Reformatter.wsf
    VBScript script to extract an SPS source code deck for the card-
    based assembler from a line printer listing transcription (.spt)
    file.

True-Complement-Gen.html
    Script to generate a complete set of true and complement digit codes
    for input the to tables generated by Adder-Gen.html from Drawing
    10.01.32.1 of the Model 2 ILD manual. See
    http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/1620/fe/227-5857-0_1620_Model_2_Custome
