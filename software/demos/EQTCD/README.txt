Table (file name index) to punched cards.

EQTCD.spt
    Original transcription of the 1968 program listing done by Paul
    Kimpel in August 2023.

EQTCD.sps
    SPS source deck extracted from EQTCD.spt. This original version
    requires the Monitor II operating system and its SPS assembler,
    which we don't presently have, thus it can't be assembled in its
    original form.

EQTCD-Monitor-I.sps
    SPS source deck extracated from EQTCD.spt with minimum modifications
    to allow it to run under Monitor I. This version requires updates to
    the SPS configuration for additional op code mnemonics in order to
    assemble under Monitor I. See retro-1620/software/ monitor/SPSLIB-
    Load-Model2-Op-Codes.card for a job that will update the SPS
    configuration.

EQTCD-Monitor-I.lst
    Assembly listing for EQTCD-Monitor-I.sps.

EQTCD-Monitor-I-Output.txt
    Combined typewriter and punched card output from EQTCD-Monitor-
    I.sps.
