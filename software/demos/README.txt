EQTCD/
    Utility written in 1968 to list the disk Equivalence Table (file
    name index) to punched cards. The original program required the
    Monitor II operating system and its SPS assembler, which we don't
    presently have. A slightly modified program is also present that,
    with updates to the SPS configuration for additional op code
    mnemonics, will assemble under Monitor I. See retro-1620/software/
